#### 1.8.1 - Greeting

>Create an app that greets the user by name.

First, we can easily generate the shiny app backbone by typing `shinyapp` into a new R script and hitting shift + tab to fetch a snippet:
```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(

)

server <- function(input, output, session) {

}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

On the frontend of the app, the UI, we want to have a box in which the user can input their name. Anything in this box will reactively be assigned as the variable `name`. To do this, add a `textInput()` function under the `ui` block. Reactive functions we will be able to fetch this variable via `input$name`.

We want to return the text string to the user so we need a text output on the front end. `textOutput()` lets us do this. The following code will return whatever text is stored in the variable `output$greeting`
```R
textinput(inputId = 'name', label = "What's your name?")
textOutput(outputId = 'greeting')
```

Now, we need to tell the server what to do. We want it to fetch whatever text is assigned under the variable `input$name` and render it in the `textOutput()` section in the frontend.
Our `textOutput()` function will reactively return whatever variable is stored under `output$greeting` so let's get the server to assign some rendered text to that variable.
```R
output$greeting <- renderText({
  paste0('Hello ', input$name, '!')
})
```

Combining all of this gives us:

```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textinput(inputId = 'name', label = "What's your name?"),
  textOutput('greeting')
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText({
        paste0('Hello ', input$name, '!')
    })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

#### 1.8.2 - Multiplication

>Suppose your friend wants to design an app that allows the user to set a number (x) between 1 and 50, and displays the result of multiplying this number by 5. This is their first attempt:

To answer the first part of this question, we can see that the code thinks the variable `x` doesn't exist. Note that despite the `inputId` of the `sliderInput()` function being `x` the code still fails. This is because `x` is in fact a reactive variable bound to `input` so we need to correct the misnomered `x` to `input$x`

```R
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$product <- renderText({
    input$x * 5
  })
}
```
&nbsp;

>Extend the app from the previous exercise to allow the user to set the value of the multiplier, y, so that the app yields the value of x * y.

To add an extra slider to define a `y` value we can copy the code for the `x` slider, changing the `inputId`.
```R
sliderInput(inputId = 'y', label = 'If y is', min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
```

Now, make the server return the product of `x` and `y`.
```R
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$product <- renderText({
    prod(input$x, input$y) #prod() calculates the product of inputs
  })
}
```

&nbsp;

>Take the following app which adds some additional functionality to the last app described in the last exercise. What’s new? How could you reduce the amount of duplicated code in the app by using a reactive expression.

The provided code is computationally wasteful as it includes several duplications of the line `product <- input$x * input$y` and we are instructed to create a reactive expression to address this.

Reactive expressions behave similar to functions but only run the first time they are called; from then on their result is cached and returned. If an input is updated, the calculation automatically reruns.

A reactive expression is created as so:
```R
reactive.exp <- reactive({

})
```

Functions can be incorporated into reactive expressions too:
```R
reactive.fn <- reactive({
  function(x, y) {
    sum(x, y)
  }
})
```
However, we can't call the reactive expression like a normal function. For example, `reactive.fn(x = 1, y = 2)` will not compile. Instead, we need to call the reactive expression first with empty parenthesis and then using a second set of parenthesis to invoke the sub-function and specify the its' variables. This method also allows for a function to handle reactive variables.
```R
## Will not compile
reactive.fn(x = 1, y = 2)

## Will compile
reactive.fn()(x = 1, y = 2)

## Sub-function variables can be reactive vars
reactive.fn()(x = input$x, y = input$y)
```

Thus, to incorporate a reactive expression into the provided code we can generate the expression `multiply` and invoke it with `multiply()(x, y, c)`.
```R
multiply <- reactive({
    function(x, y, c) {
        sum(prod(x, y), c)
    }
})
```

Bringing all of this together, the following code renders a shiny page that calculates the question's stipulated values and also adds an extra slider to modulate the `c` value of the equation `(x * y) + c`:

```R
{
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
    sliderInput("x", label = "If x is", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30),
    sliderInput('y', label = 'If y is', min = 1, max = 50, value = 30),
    sliderInput('c', label = 'If c is', min = 1, max = 50, value = 30),
    "then, (x * y) is", textOutput("product"),
    "and, (x * y) + 5 is", textOutput("product_plus5"),
    "and (x * y) + 10 is", textOutput("product_plus10"),
    "and (x * y) + c is", textOutput('product_plusc')
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    # Create a reactive expression `multiply()` to calculate the product of `x` & `y` and add a value, `c`.
    multiply <- reactive({
        function(x, y, c) {
            sum(prod(x, y), c)
        }
    })

    output$product <- renderText({
        multiply()(input$x, input$y, 0) # Note that reactive expressions with functions within must be called with reactive()(fn.var1, ...)
    })

    output$product_plus5 <- renderText({
        multiply()(input$x, input$y, 5)
    })

    output$product_plus10 <- renderText({
        multiply()(input$x, input$y, 10)
    })

    output$product_plusc <- renderText({
        multiply()(input$x, input$y, input$c)
    })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
}
```

#### 1.8.5 ggplot2-Datasets
>The following app is very similar to one you’ve seen earlier in the chapter: you select a dataset from a package (this time we’re using the ggplot2 package) and the app prints out a summary and plot of the data. It also follows good practice and makes use of reactive expressions to avoid redundancy of code. However there are three bugs in the code provided below. Can you find and fix them?

```R
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

datasets <- c("economics", "faithfuld", "seals")
ui <- fluidPage(
    selectInput("dataset", "Dataset", choices = datasets),
    verbatimTextOutput("summary"),
    plotOutput("plot") #`tableOutput` corrected to `plotOutput`
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    dataset <- reactive({
        get(input$dataset, "package:ggplot2")
    })
    output$summary <- renderPrint({ #extra 'm' in 'summary'
        summary(dataset())
    })
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
        plot(dataset())},  #missing parenthesis on `dataset` reactive expression
        res = 96)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
