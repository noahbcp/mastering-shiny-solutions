**1.8.1 - Greeting**

We want to create a simple app that will return an input, `name`, appended to a string of text.

First, we can easily generate the shiny app backbone by typing `shinyapp` into a new R script and hitting shift + tab to fetch a snippet:
```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(

)

server <- function(input, output, session) {

}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

On the frontend of the app, the UI, we want to have a box in which the user can input their name. Anything in this box will reactively be assigned as the variable `name`. To do this, add a `textInput()` function under the `ui` block. Reactive functions we will be able to fetch this variable via `input$name`.

We want to return the text string to the user so we need a text output on the front end. `textOutput()` lets us do this. The following code will return whatever text is stored in the variable `output$greeting`
```R
textinput(inputId = 'name', label = "What's your name?")
textOutput(outputId = 'greeting')
```

Combining all of this gives us:

```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textinput(inputId = 'name', label = "What's your name?"),
  textOutput('greeting')
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText({
        paste0('Hello ', input$name, '!')
    })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
