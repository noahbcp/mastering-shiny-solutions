#### 2.2.8 - Inputs
>When space is at a premium, it’s useful to label text boxes using a placeholder that appears inside the text entry area. How do you call textInput() to generate the UI below?

```R
## Placeholder variable dictates placeholder text.
## Note that label must be defined but can be empty.
textInput(inputId = 'text', label = '', placeholder = 'Your name')

```

>Carefully read the documentation for sliderInput() to create a date slider.

```R
## View help documentation for sliderInput()
?sliderInput

## Create a date slider
sliderInput('date',
            label = 'Date Slider',
            value = as.Date('2022-06-01'), ## as.Date() creates a date object
            min = as.Date('2022-01-01'),
            max = as.Date('2022-12-31'),
            timeFormat = "%F%") ## %F% denotes the format %yyyy%-%mm%-%dd%
```

>Create a slider input to select values between 0 and 100 where the interval between each selectable value on the slider is 5. Then, add animation to the input widget so when the user presses play the input widget scrolls through the range automatically.

```R
sliderInput('animated',
  label = 'Animated Slider',
  value = 0,
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  step = 5, # Dictates step interval
  animate = TRUE # Allows animation
)

## animationOptions() can be invoked to control how the animation behaves
sliderInput('animated',
  label = 'Animated Slider',
  value = 0,
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  step = 5, # Dictates step interval
  animate = animationOptions(
    interval = 200, # Time between each step (in ms)
    loop = TRUE # Does the animation loop? (TRUE / FALSE)
    )
)
```

>If you have a moderately long list in a selectInput(), it’s useful to create sub-headings that break the list up into pieces.

```R
## Create a named list `cars`
cars <- list(`Japanese` = list('Mitsubishi', 'Toyota', 'Suzuki'),
                `Korean` = list('Hyundai', 'Datsun'),
                `European` = list('Volkswagen', 'BMW', 'Audi'))

## selectInput can parse named lists as the 'choices' variable and will group by name
selectInput('select', 'Select Input', choices = cars)
```

**Named lists - A deeper dive**

Using named lists is especially powerful for larger datasets. For example, say I want to allow the user to select which model of car they're interested in from the `ggplot2::mpg` dataset. As this dataset includes 234 car models it would lead to a pretty horrible user experience if corresponding `selectInput` box was not organised in any way.

An obvious parameter to group the models by is their manufacturer. To do this I will use some functions within the `dplyr` package (included in `tidyverse`).
```R
library(tidyverse)
cars <- ggplot2::mpg %>%
    summarise(manufacturer, model, year) %>%
    group_by(manufacturer) %>%
    group_split()
```
This produces the list `cars` which includes 15 individual tables; each corresponding to an individual manufacturer.

I wanted to also fill the list of choices with the a string including the model & year. To accomplish this I used a loop but there is probably a more elegant way. As `selectInput` requires a named list to correctly group choices, the final line of code names all of the sublists within `choices` by the corresponding manufacturer name:
```R
choices <- list()
i <- 1
while (i <= length(cars)) {
    choices[i] = list(paste(cars[[i]]$model, cars[[i]]$year))
    i <- i + 1
}
names(choices) <- unique(mpg$manufacturer)
```

#### 2.3.5 - Outputs
>Which of textOutput() and verbatimTextOutput() should each of the following render functions be paired with?
* renderPrint(summary(mtcars))
* renderText("Good morning!")
* renderPrint(t.test(1:5, 2:6))
* renderText(str(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)))

`verbatimTextOutput()` prints text how it would appear in the console and is typically paired with `renderPrint()` to print more complicated text-based outputs that require fixed-width text such as `renderPrint(summary(mtcars))` and `renderPrint(t.test(1:5, 2:6))`.

Conversely, `textOuput()` combines the result into a single string and returns it. It is typically paired with `renderText()`. For the above examples, `textOutput` is best suited for `renderText('Good morning!')`.

The fourth example, `renderText(str(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)))` is a trick question as, though it is wrapped a `renderText` function it cannot be output by either `textOutput()` nor `verbatimTextOutput()`. Instead, one needs to change the function to `renderPrint(str(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)))` and output it via `verbatimTextOutput()`.

>Re-create the Shiny app from Section 2.3.3, this time setting height to 300px and width to 700px. Set the plot “alt” text so that a visually impaired user can tell that its a scatterplot of five random numbers.

```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  ## Change height & width values in plotOutput
  plotOutput("plot", width = "700px", height = "300px")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ## The `alt` argument is used to dictates the html that will be read by a screen reader if the image/plot is not printed.
  output$plot <- renderPlot(plot(1:5), res = 96, alt = 'A scatterplot of five random numbers.')
}
```

>Update the options in the call to renderDataTable() below so that the data is displayed, but all other controls are suppress (i.e. remove the search, ordering, and filtering commands). You’ll need to read ?renderDataTable and review the options at https://datatables.net/reference/option/.

The `options` argument of `renderDataTable` allows us to change how the final datatable will look. The options that we can use are all found in the [datatables.net reference](https://datatables.net/reference/option/). The ones we want to change are `searching` and `ordering`. **Note that all of these options must be called as a list.**

```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  dataTableOutput("table")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$table <- renderDataTable(mtcars, options = list(pageLength = 5, searching = FALSE, ordering = FALSE))
}
```
