#### 2.2.8 - Inputs
>When space is at a premium, it’s useful to label text boxes using a placeholder that appears inside the text entry area. How do you call textInput() to generate the UI below?

```R
## Placeholder variable dictates placeholder text.
## Note that label must be defined but can be empty.
textInput(inputId = 'text', label = '', placeholder = 'Your name')

```

>Carefully read the documentation for sliderInput() to create a date slider.

```R
## View help documentation for sliderInput()
?sliderInput

## Create a date slider
sliderInput('date',
            label = 'Date Slider',
            value = as.Date('2022-06-01'), ## as.Date() creates a date object
            min = as.Date('2022-01-01'),
            max = as.Date('2022-12-31'),
            timeFormat = "%F%") ## %F% denotes the format %yyyy%-%mm%-%dd%
```

>Create a slider input to select values between 0 and 100 where the interval between each selectable value on the slider is 5. Then, add animation to the input widget so when the user presses play the input widget scrolls through the range automatically.

```R
sliderInput('animated',
  label = 'Animated Slider',
  value = 0,
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  step = 5, # Dictates step interval
  animate = TRUE # Allows animation
)

## animationOptions() can be invoked to control how the animation behaves
sliderInput('animated',
  label = 'Animated Slider',
  value = 0,
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  step = 5, # Dictates step interval
  animate = animationOptions(
    interval = 200, # Time between each step (in ms)
    loop = TRUE # Does the animation loop? (TRUE / FALSE)
    )
)
```

>If you have a moderately long list in a selectInput(), it’s useful to create sub-headings that break the list up into pieces.

```R
## Create a named list `cars`
cars <- list(`Japanese` = list('Mitsubishi', 'Toyota', 'Suzuki'),
                `Korean` = list('Hyundai', 'Datsun'),
                `European` = list('Volkswagen', 'BMW', 'Audi'))

## selectInput can parse named lists as the 'choices' variable and will group by name
selectInput('select', 'Select Input', choices = cars)
```

**Named lists - A deeper dive**

Using named lists is especially powerful for larger datasets. For example, say I want to allow the user to select which model of car they're interested in from the `ggplot2::mpg` dataset. As this dataset includes 234 car models it would lead to a pretty horrible user experience if corresponding `selectInput` box was not organised in any way.

An obvious parameter to group the models by is their manufacturer. To do this I will use some functions within the `dplyr` package (included in `tidyverse`).
```R
library(tidyverse)
cars <- ggplot2::mpg %>%
    summarise(manufacturer, model, year) %>%
    group_by(manufacturer) %>%
    group_split()
```
This produces the list `cars` which includes 15 individual tables; each corresponding to an individual manufacturer.

I wanted to also fill the list of choices with the a string including the model & year. To accomplish this I created a simple loop function but there is probably a more elegant way of doing this. As `selectInput` requires a named list to correctly group choices, the final line of code names all of the sublists within `choices` by the corresponding manufacturer name:
```R
choices <- list()
i <- 1
while (i <= length(cars)) {
    choices[i] = list(paste(cars[[i]]$model, cars[[i]]$year))
    i <- i + 1
}
names(choices) <- unique(mpg$manufacturer)
```
